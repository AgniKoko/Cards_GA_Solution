# Card Separation Problem â€“ Genetic Algorithm Solution in MATLAB

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description
This project addresses a combinatorial optimization problem using a genetic algorithm in MATLAB.

You are given 15 unique cards numbered from **1 to 15**, and the goal is to divide them equally into **three piles** such that:

- The **sum** of the first pile is exactly **49**.
- The **sum** of the second pile is exactly **33**.
- The **product** of the third pile is exactly **12,600**.

This is a **constraint-based partitioning problem** that cannot be solved by brute force efficiently due to the vast number of permutations, and thus, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used.

---

## Solution Overview

The genetic algorithm (GA) was customized for the nature of this problem:
- Each individual (genome) represents a permutation of numbers 1 through 15.
- The GA evolves this population of permutations through:
  - **Custom Initialization**
  - **Custom Crossover and Mutation**
  - **Fitness evaluation** based on deviation from the target sums and product.

## File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cards_ga.m`     | Main script that sets up and runs the GA |
| `cards_fitness.m`        | Fitness function: penalizes deviation from desired pile values |
| `cards_permutations.m`   | Custom creation function (random valid permutations) |
| `cards_crossover.m`      | Custom crossover: reshuffles one card from each pile |
| `cards_mutations.m`      | Custom mutation: swaps two cards |

| `FitnessLimit` | `0` | Stops early when all targets are exactly met |
| `Generations` | `800` | Allows enough time for convergence |
| `PopulationSize` | `200` | Ensures diverse initial population |
| `StallGenLimit` | `10000` | Prevents premature stopping due to stagnation |
